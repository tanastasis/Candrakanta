    Welcome to Ārśi-Candrayantra — an engine generating Tocharian A words.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
    Use the menu on the left to explore lexemes, morphemes and rules.
  </p>

  <p class="leading-relaxed">
    By clicking on a <a class="text-[var(--link-color)] underline" href="/lexeme/C_pättāñkät">lexeme</a>, you will see its full paradigm.
    Toggle the “Show all variants button” to include less frequent form variants.
    Click on a form to see its derivation below the table. While down there, you may also add postfixes (otherwise referred to as enclitics)
    to the form. In the first row you can click to see the morphemes which comprise the form.
    Clicking on highlighted forms will lead you to a sublexeme’s page: for example,
    from the lexeme <a class="text-[var(--link-color)] underline" href="/lexeme/C_oṅkălmā">oṅkaläm “elephant”</a> you can go to the sublexeme
    <a class="text-[var(--link-color)] underline" href="/lexeme/C_oṅkălmā?sub=F">oṅkälmāñc “she-elephant”</a>.
    If you want to create your own sublexeme, just add "?sub=M1.M2.…" to the address, where M1, M2, … are the names of the morphemes you want to append;
    for example, to get a possessive adjective from <a class="text-[var(--link-color)] underline" href="/lexeme/C_ārṣălā">ārṣal “snake”</a> change “/C_ārṣălā” to “/C_ārṣălā?sub=POS”.
  </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed">
    Forms and sublexemes are built dynamically so please don’t mind a little lag.
  </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed">
    On the “Morphemes” page clicking on a morpheme will show you the lexemes that contain it and the rules in which the morpheme
    is mentioned (directly or as part of a group).
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
    Tocharian A is a dead language, and as all the surviving manuscripts are badly damaged, any attempt at a generative grammar
    involves serious conjecture. The forms built by the Candrayantra reflect my current, and constantly evolving, understanding of
    the language. In the worst cases — in areas where the surviving evidence is the most frugal — the decisions made may appear 
    as random guesses. Few of them will stand the test of time, if fate chooses to shed light on those areas.
    My responsibility is to make sure that those forms that are actually found in the texts are built correctly 
    by this grammar.

  <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
    The grammar itself, called <a class="text-[var(--link-color)] underline" href="/candrakanta.pdf">Ārśi-Candrakānta</a>,
    has been largely inspired by Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī and strives towards the same completeness and brevity,
    the chief difference being that the Candrakānta’s rules are strictly ordered.
    The morphological model I use slightly differs from the ones usually followed in Tocharian studies.
    It is strictly agglutinative, and every meaning in a word is expressed by exactly one morpheme. For causativity,
    it means that all causative verb forms possess a morpheme K “causative”, whereas all non-causative forms have
    a morpheme V “volitive”. Like in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, all forms except finite verbal forms, must end in a case,
    including indeclinable words (which usually end in NOM). In the transcription, against the common conventions,
    I differentiate between <i>z</i>, an affricate, and <i>ts</i>, a consonant cluster, as argued for

    My understanding of the Tocharian A language has been greatly influenced by <a class="text-[var(--link-color)] underline" href="https://independent.academia.edu/IlyaItkin">Ilya Itkin</a>,
    mainly by his unpublished grammar, co-authored with Svetlana Burlak, and through a decade-long discussion
    of both textual and grammatical matters of the language.
    Many of his rules and interpretations, both published and unpublished, have been accepted here.
